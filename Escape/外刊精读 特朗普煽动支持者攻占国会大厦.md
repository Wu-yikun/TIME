#### When does a fiery speech cross the line into incitement?

Johnson’s first column after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 looked at “speech acts”, or what J.L. Austin, a philosopher, called “doing things with words”. Part of a president’s awesome power is that merely by opening his mouth he can set the official policy of the United States. Mr Trump, that column concluded, needed to learn to watch his words, given that they would soon constitute official acts.

He did not. Now he has been impeached for an offence grounded in speech: incitement of insurrection. On January 6th he delivered a tirade near the White House protesting that November’s election had been stolen from him. Soon the Capitol building at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where legislators were certifying the vote, was ransacked by his audience. Five people died. Mr Trump’s accusers say he incited the violence, his defenders that he merely gave a typically barnstorming speech, and was not responsible for the mob.

The “solicitation” statute requires intent by the speaker that another person should commit a crime. In 1969 the Supreme Court added two further tests in Brandenburg v Ohio. Such speech was bannable only if “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action”.

Which of these three tests—the speaker’s intent, the imminence of a crime and its likelihood—are met in the case of the Capitol riot? Imminence, clearly: the mob was in the Capitol building within an hour of Mr Trump’s harangue. What he intended, though, is less starkly obvious.

The president used the word “fight” 20 times. But such words can be employed metaphorically—Mr Trump also referred to members of Congress who took his side in rejecting the election results as “warriors”. He never explicitly said “Ransack the Capitol”. The mob, in this defence, took matters into its own hands. Indeed, at one point Mr Trump said the crowd should “peacefully…make your voices heard”.

What was the crowd thinking when Mr Trump said, “We must stop the steal”—and how was it likely to respond? Further guidance might have been found in Mr Trump’s assertion that “when you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules. You have to be strong, we fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more.”The crowd—containing, as the president ought to have known, numerous avowed extremists—could assume either that his superabundant fighting talk was irrelevant, or that his single mention of peaceful protest was. Mr Trump surely knows how devoted his followers are. “Our president wants us here,” one said inside the Capitol. “We wait and take orders from our president.”

#### 第一段

When does a fiery speech **cross the line** into **incitement**?

> 激情演讲何时越界演变为煽动暴乱



Johnson’s first column after the election of Donald Trump in 2016 looked at “speech acts”, or what J.L. Austin, a philosopher, called “doing things with words”. Part of a president’s awesome power is that merely by opening his mouth he can set the official policy of the United States. Mr Trump, that column concluded, needed to learn to watch his words, given that they would soon **constitute** official acts.

> 在唐纳德·特朗普2016年大选后，Johnson的第一个专栏讲述了“言语行为”，即哲学家J.L. Austin所说的“用言语行事”。总统其令人敬畏的权力之一便是只需张张嘴，就可以制定美国的官方政策。该专栏得出结论，鉴于这些言论将很快变成官方行为，特朗普先生需要学会管住他的嘴。

#### 第二段

He did not. Now he has been **impeached** for an offence grounded in speech: incitement of **insurrection**. On January 6th he **delivered** a tirade near the White House protesting that November’s election had been stolen from him. Soon the Capitol building at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, where legislators were **certifying** the vote, was ransacked by his audience. Five people died. Mr Trump’s accusers say he incited the violence, his defenders that he merely gave a typically barnstorming speech, and was not responsible for the mob.

> 他没做到。现在他因言语上过失而被弹劾：煽动叛乱。1月6日，他在白宫附近发表长篇大论，抗议在11月份的大选将总统之位从他手中夺走。很快，在宾夕法尼亚州大道另一端的国会大厦，立法者们进行投票证明的地方，遭到了他的听众的洗劫。造成五人死亡。特朗普的控诉者说，他煽动了暴力；他的辩护者则称，他只是发表了典型的巡回政治演说，对暴徒不负责。

- **deliver** 最初的意思，表示“运送包裹、信件等”。所以“送货员”可以说“delivery man”,“快递公司”也可以说“delivery company”。

#### 第三段

The “**solicitation**” statute requires intent by the speaker that another person should **commit a crime**. In 1969 the Supreme Court added two further tests in Brandenburg v Ohio. Such speech was bannable only if “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action”.

> “犯罪教唆”指的是演讲者意图使他人犯罪。1969年，最高法院在勃兰登堡诉俄亥俄案中又增加了两个检验标准。这种言论只有“旨在煽动或产生危急的不法行为”和“可能煽动或产生此类行为”时，才可被禁止。







- **solicitation** 英 [səˌlɪsɪ'təɪʃn]美 [səˌlɪsəˈteʃən]

  ①请求；诱使；怂恿；恳求

  ②犯罪教唆；要求、鼓励、引诱、唆使、煽动他人从事非法行为的不完全的罪行。该词用于如教唆卖淫、教唆盗窃、教唆行贿等词组之中。



**【词组】** Solicitation of bribe 索贿；No Solicitation 禁止招揽对方雇员（英美合同法）



**【例句】**

Republican leaders are making open solicitation of the Italian-American vote.

> 共和党领袖公开向意大利裔美国人拉选票。



- **commit a crime** 表示犯罪；犯下罪行



**【例句】**

Though he has confessed to the killings, he denies he committed a crime.

> 尽管他承认自己的杀戮行为，但他否认这是犯罪。





#### 第四段

Which of these three tests—the speaker’s intent, the imminence of a crime and its **likelihood**—are met **in the case of** the Capitol riot? Imminence, clearly: the mob was in the Capitol building within an hour of Mr Trump’s harangue. What he intended, though, is less starkly obvious.

> 在国会大厦暴乱事件中，这三个检验标准——意图、犯罪的迫近性及其可能性——哪一个符合？迫近性，很明显：特朗普长篇大论发表后的一小时内，暴徒就聚集在国会大厦。不过，他的意图并不那么明显。







- **likelihood** 表示可能, 可能性



**【近义词】** probability



**【反义词】** unlikelihood, unlikeliness



**【常用短语】**

in all likelihood adv. 十分可能

**【例句】**

In all likelihood, the treaty will nonetheless be approved.

> 然而，该条约十有八九都会得以通过。



- **in the case of** 它表示的是“至于..., 在...情况下” 类似于写作中的as for，regarding 表示的是提及一件事情。



**【例句】** 

In the case of diligent students，attending university is not difficult。

> 对于勤奋的学生来说，读大学不是很难。



**【近义词组】**



**in case** 表示的是“以防万一，提前作准备”。in case是连词短语，所谓连词短语，就后面可以跟着完整的句子，比如and，because 这些都是连词，后面可以跟着句子。



**in case of** 表示的是“如果/如果发生某事该如何应对” 。in case of的意思和in case非常相似，只是of是介词，所以后面要加n，或doing。



总结起来就是in case 和 in case of 都是表示一种如果的情况



in case+句子，in case of+词组



比如写这个句子：政府应当对违反吸烟的行为进行罚款



如果你没学过in the case of，大家会写成：

*The authority should impose a fine to those who smoke in smoke-free areas.*



但是如果用in the case of 就可以写成6.5+的水平：

*The authority should impose a fine in the case of smokers who break the non-smoking regulation.*



更高端的7+表达方式：

*The authority should impose a fine in the case of non-compliance with the non-smoking regulation.*





#### 第五段

The president used the word “fight” 20 times. But such words can be employed metaphorically—Mr Trump also **referred to** members of Congress who took his side in rejecting the election results **as** “warriors”. He never explicitly said “Ransack the Capitol”. The mob, in this defence, **took matters into its own hands**. Indeed, at one point Mr Trump said the crowd should “peacefully…make your voices heard”.

> 总统使用了20次“斗争”这个词。但是这个词也可以当成是比喻的措辞——特朗普还提到了反对选举结果的国会议员是“战士”。他从未明确说过"洗劫国会大厦"。辩护称，暴民们是自己参与的。特朗普曾一度表示，群众应该“和平抗议……让你们的声音能够被听到”。



- **refer to sb. as** 是固定词组，意为“称某人为...；把某人称作...”，介词to不可省略。



**【例句】**

English is referred to as a universal language. 

> 英文被称为世界语言。



- **take matters into sb. own hands** – 英译: to do something oneself instead of waiting for other people to do something. 指亲自参与；掌握在自己手中





#### 第六段

What was the crowd thinking when Mr Trump said, “We must stop the steal”—and how was it likely to respond? Further guidance might have been found in Mr Trump’s assertion that “when you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules. You have to be strong, we fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more.” The crowd—containing, as the president **ought to** have known, numerous avowed extremists—could assume either that his superabundant fighting talk was **irrelevant**, or that his single mention of peaceful protest was. Mr Trump surely knows how devoted his followers are. “Our president wants us here,” one said inside the Capitol. “We wait and take orders from our president.”

> 当特朗普说：“我们必须停止盗窃行为。”是群众会怎么想——又将如何回应呢？我们可以在特朗普的言论中找到进一步的指导，即“当你们发现某人欺诈时，你们可以不按规矩来。你们必须坚强，我们坚决斗争，若你们不坚决斗争，则国将不国。”这些群众里包含许多公开的极端分子（总统应该知道的），所以可以假设要么他的众多战斗言论是无关紧要的，要么他的和平抗议只是顺嘴一提。特朗普清楚知道他的追随者是多么的忠实。一个在国会大厦内的人这么说到：“我们的总统希望我们在这里，我们在等待并响应我们的总统的命令。”



- **ought to** 表示应该，ought to的否定式为ought not to，疑问形式是将ought置于主语前，其用法与should的基本相同 。



**【例句】**

You ought not to be late for such an important meeting.

> 这么重要的会议你不应该迟到的。



Ought to与should差别很小，should多表达自己的主观想法，ought to则多反映客观情况，在谈及法律，义务和规定或要使自己的意见听起来有力时常ought to。



**【例句】**

You should ought to go and see Mary sometime.

> 你应该找个时间去看看玛丽。



- **irrelevant** 不相干的；不恰当的



**【反义词】** relevant



**【常用短语】** irrelevant to 与...不相关



**【例句】**

Facebook, Twitter and Google are largely irrelevant on the mainland.

> Facebook, Twitter和Google基本上都无法涉足这个市场。
